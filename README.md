# SudokuSolver

This is an independant project I made that combined different experiences I had in class during my undergraduate degree. 

## Description

Using the Dancing Links Algorithm by David Knuth to solve sudokus fast. The game is fully functioning but it is not completed currently.

The game is fully written in Java with some CSS elements written for JavaFX. It uses JavaFx 15.0.1. You can fully play the 99 levels
with a save function for each puzzle. They are of variable difficulty.
